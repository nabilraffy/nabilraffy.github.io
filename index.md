## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 4 Part 1

Lab 4 was really interesting to me because I was able to learn about doubles. I was confused at the start about what it was about and then I learned how you can use it to convert volume to oz. It took me a while to understand but i got the hang of it.

Lab 6 part 2

This was another one of the other labs i was interested in because i wanted to get into blackjack to play here and there with friends. The coding helped me find certain values of a blackjack hand even though how many aces were being given. Along with that i was able to memorize certain values after some repetition

Lab 7 part 1

This was also was another one that i was happy to do because it was decently easy to do. Since it was only one part we were able to use our time and actually learn more about the certain street rules. We had to use clang++ and that was pretty interesting to see what it was capable of.
